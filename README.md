# instadefuse
Plugin to allow CT's to instantly defuse the bomb when no T's are alive and other circumstances

A simple plugin made for retake servers or anything similar. 


Counter-Terrorists have the ability to instantly defuse the bomb if:
No Terrorists are alive.
There is a sufficient amount of time remaining (depending if the defuser has a kit or not).
If there are no active Molotov's that could damage the defuser

Commands:
sm_instadefuse_enabled - 1 by default (to enable or disable plugin)
